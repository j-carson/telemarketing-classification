The data for this project can be downloaded from 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.

When unpacking the download, two subdirectories are created: ```bank``` and ```bank-additional```. 

```bank-additional``` needs to be installed here for the files in ```src``` to work. The ```bank``` directory (an earlier version of the dataset with fewer predictors) is not used.
